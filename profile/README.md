**CameLLM** is a collection of Swift packages to support running LLMs (including the LLaMA family and GPT-J models) locally on macOS (and hopefully in the future, iOS) with modern, clean, Swift bindings

⚠️ CameLLM is currently under development, but you can read more about the current status of the project in the [main CameLLM repository](https://github.com/CameLLM/CameLLM).
